## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Each system case study follows a structured approach:

1. **Problem** — What manual operation is being replaced?
2. **Constraints** — Technical, business, and operational limitations
3. **System Architecture** — End-to-end system design
4. **AI vs Deterministic Logic** — Strategic decision-making framework
5. **Failure Modes & Safeguards** — Production-grade reliability measures
6. **Results & Impact** — Quantified business outcomes
7. **Future Improvements** — Iterative enhancement roadmap
