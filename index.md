# Jason's AI Systems Portfolio

Designing and shipping production-grade AI systems that replace manual operations.

---

## Overview

This portfolio showcases real-world AI systems rather than experimental demos. Each case study emphasizes system architecture, constraints, decision-making, and measurable impact.

**Platform:** GitHub Pages | **Cost:** $0 | **Format:** Markdown-driven static site

---

## Design Principles

- **Minimalist, documentation-first aesthetic** — Engineering clarity over visual flair
- **Diagrams over decoration** — Architecture visuals that explain system design
- **Clear hierarchy and scannability** — Value communicated in under 60 seconds
- **Production focus** — Real systems with real constraints and real impact

## Case Study Structure

Each AI system case study includes:

1. **Problem** — What manual operation is being replaced?
2. **Constraints** — Technical, business, and operational limitations
3. **System Architecture** — How the system works end-to-end
4. **AI vs Deterministic Logic** — When and why AI is used vs. rules
5. **Failure Modes & Safeguards** — How the system handles edge cases
6. **Results & Impact** — Measurable outcomes and metrics
7. **What I'd Improve Next** — Iterative improvements and lessons learned
