# AI System Case Studies

This directory contains individual case studies for each AI system.

## Adding a New Case Study

1. Copy `template.md` to create a new case study file
2. Name it descriptively (e.g., `document-classifier.md`)
3. Fill in all sections following the template structure
4. Add architecture diagrams to `/diagrams/` and reference them
5. Add sample outputs to `/assets/` if available
6. Update the main README.md to link to your new case study
